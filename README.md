# JSON Editing

The general aim is to provide a single point of editing for all members to add
aliases and edit the documents to enrich our ability to make the search results
more relavent. 

There is a MongoDB server running which we will be creating a SSHtunnel to, once
the connection is established we can use [**Robomongo**] to provide a graphical
interface to modify the documents present on the MongoDB server.

TODO:

* come up with common scheme for adding aliases
* come up with common scheme for adding last-edited etc
